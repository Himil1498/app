- Features:
  - Full measurement UI with controls
  - Real-time distance display
  - Segment-by-segment measurement table
  - Save/clear functionality
  - Interactive map with measurement tools

### 3. Enhanced: `GISToolContainer.jsx`
- Location: `src/components/4.NetworkPage/4.1 AllToolContainer/GISComponents/GISToolContainer.jsx`
- Enhancements:
  - Added measurement dialog integration
  - Enhanced WOK tools with prominent "Measure Distance" button
  - Notification system integration
  - Dialog modal overlay system

## How to Use

### From WOK Control Panel
1. Open the GIS Tool Container
2. In the WOK Control Center (left panel), scroll to "WOK Tools" section
3. Click the prominent blue "Measure Distance" button
4. A full-screen measurement dialog will open

### From Sidebar (Existing)
1. In the sidebar, go to "Analysis Tools" section
2. Click "Measure Distance"
3. This will trigger the `setMeasurementDialog(true)` function

### Using the Measurement Tool
1. Click "Start Measurement" to begin
2. Click on the map to add measurement points
3. Each click adds a new point and shows segment distances
4. Double-click to finish measuring
5. View results in the segments table
6. Save measurements to localStorage
7. Clear to start over

## Technical Features

### API Integration
- Uses `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY` from `.env` file
- Loads Google Maps API with geometry and drawing libraries
- Proper error handling for missing API key

### Measurement Capabilities
- Real-time distance calculation using Haversine formula
- Support for multiple segments
- Accurate measurement within India boundaries
- Visual feedback with markers and polylines

### UI/UX Features
- Modern Material-UI design
- Responsive layout
- Loading states and error handling
- Notifications for user feedback
- Segment-by-segment analysis table

## Environment Setup
Make sure your `.env` file contains:
```
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY=AIzaSyAT5j5Zy8q4XSHLi1arcpkce8CNvbljbUQ
```

## Testing Steps
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the GIS interface
3. Click "Measure Distance" from WOK tools
4. Test clicking on the map to add points
5. Verify distance calculations
6. Test saving and clearing functionality

## Build Status
- ✅ Build successful (`npm run build`)
- ✅ Development server running (`npm run dev`)
- ✅ All dependencies resolved
- ✅ No build errors or warnings

The implementation is complete and ready for use!
