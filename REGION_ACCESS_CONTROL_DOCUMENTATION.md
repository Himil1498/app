# 🗺️ Region-Based Access Control System Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive region-based access control system implemented in the React + Google Maps GIS Professional Dashboard. The system uses actual India state boundary data to enforce precise geographic access restrictions for all GIS tools.

## 🎯 Key Features

### ✅ **Implemented Features**

1. **Perfect Polygon Boundaries**
   - Uses actual India state boundary data from `public/india.json`
   - Supports MultiPolygon GeoJSON format with precise coordinates
   - Converts GeoJSON to Google Maps polygon format automatically

2. **Visual Region Highlighting**
   - Assigned regions are highlighted with blue overlays on map load
   - Perfect state boundary shapes (not rectangles)
   - Clear visual indication of accessible areas

3. **Complete Tool Integration**
   - ✅ **Distance Measurement Tool** - Region access control
   - ✅ **Polygon Drawing Tool** - Region access control  
   - ✅ **Elevation Tool** - Region access control
   - ✅ **Infrastructure Tools** - Region access control with data filtering
   - ✅ **All Map Interactions** - Region access control

4. **User Role Management**
   - **Admin Role**: Full access to all regions across India
   - **Manager Role**: Access to multiple assigned states
   - **User Role**: Access to specific assigned states only

5. **Real-time Access Enforcement**
   - Blocks clicks outside assigned regions
   - Shows clear warning: "You do not have permission to access this area."
   - Prevents tool usage in restricted areas

6. **Infrastructure Data Filtering**
   - When infrastructure layers are enabled, only shows data within assigned regions
   - Filters POP, Sub-POP, imported, and manual locations
   - Automatic filtering on layer load and display

```

### Data Flow

```
1. User Login → Load assigned regions from localStorage/API
2. Region Normalization → Convert state names to polygon boundaries
3. Map Initialization → Draw region overlays on map
4. Tool Interaction → Check coordinate access before allowing action
5. Access Control → Block/Allow based on region boundaries
6. Infrastructure Load → Filter data to assigned regions
```

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### 1. India States Boundary Integration

**File**: `src/utils/indiaStatesUtils.js`

```javascript
// Key Functions:
- loadIndiaStatesData()           // Loads from /india.json
- getAvailableStates()            // Gets all state names
- getStateBoundary(stateName)     // Gets specific state boundary
- convertGeoJSONToGoogleMaps()    // Converts to Google Maps format
- isCoordinateAccessible()        // Checks if coordinate is accessible
- createRegionOverlays()          // Creates visual overlays
```

**Features**:
- Loads actual India state boundaries from GeoJSON
- Supports MultiPolygon geometry for complex state shapes
- Handles coordinate system conversion (GeoJSON → Google Maps)
- Uses ray-casting algorithm for boundary checking (reliable for complex polygons)

### 2. Enhanced API Service

**File**: `src/services/api.js`

```javascript
// Enhanced Functions:
- getStaticRegions()              // Returns all available states
- normalizeRegionsInput()         // Converts state names to boundaries
- handleCreateUser()              // Creates users with region assignments
- handleLogin()                   // Loads user regions on login
```

**Features**:
- Automatically converts state names to actual polygon boundaries
- Loads polygon data for both string and object regions
- Supports both development (localStorage) and production modes
- Handles async region data loading with proper error handling
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing region formats

### 3. Region Access Control

**File**: `src/components/WorkingMeasurementMap.jsx`

```javascript
// Key Functions:
- drawUserRegions()               // Highlights assigned regions
- isCoordinateAccessible()        // Checks coordinate access
- Enhanced click handlers         // All tools respect region boundaries
```

**Features**:
- Visual region highlighting using actual state boundaries
- Real-time access control for all GIS tools
- Clear warning messages for blocked actions
- Seamless integration with existing map functionality

### 4. Infrastructure Filtering

**File**: `src/components/WorkingMeasurementMap.jsx`

- Automatic filtering in `loadKmlLayer()` for POP/Sub-POP
- Filtering in `importCSVFile()` and `importXLSXFile()` for imported data
- Filtering in manual locations display useEffect
- Uses `isCoordinateAccessible()` to check each marker's position
- Only displays infrastructure data within assigned regions

    username: "admin",
    password: "admin123",
    role: "Admin",
    regions: [{ id: 'bharat', name: 'Bharat', bounds: null }]  // Full access

    password: "manager123",
    role: "Manager",
    regions: ["Maharashtra", "Karnataka"]  // Multiple states
  },
  {
    username: "user1",
    password: "user123", 
    role: "Normal User",
    regions: ["Gujarat"]  // Single state
  }
];
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Region Overlays Not Showing**
   ```
   Check: India.json file exists in public folder
   Check: Google Maps API key is valid
   Check: User has assigned regions
   ```

2. **Tools Not Blocked Outside Regions**
   ```
   Check: regionEnforcementEnabled is true
   Check: User is not admin (admins have full access)
   Check: Google Maps geometry library is loaded
   ```

3. **Incorrect Boundary Detection**
   ```
   Check: State names match exactly with india.json (case-insensitive)
   Check: Polygon data is valid GeoJSON format
   Check: Coordinate system is correct (WGS84)
   Check: Use fallback ray-casting if Google geometry issues
   Debug: Add console.logs to isCoordinateAccessible to verify checks
   ```

4. **Infrastructure Data Not Filtered**
   ```
   Check: regionEnforcementEnabled is true
   Check: User has assigned regions
   Check: Data points have valid lat/lng
   Check: isCoordinateAccessible() returns correct values
   ```

5. **Cannot Draw in Assigned Region**
   ```
   Check: Click point is truly inside highlighted boundary
   Check: User regions have polygonPaths (not just bounds)
   Check: Reload app after user creation/login
   Check: No console errors in boundary checking
   Debug: Temporarily disable insideIndia check to isolate
   Debug: Verify point coordinates are within state
   Debug: Check if region normalization added polygonPaths
   Debug: Test with admin user to isolate region issue
   ```

### Debug Information

Enable debug logs to see detailed information:

```javascript
// In WorkingMeasurementMap component
const [showDebugLogs, setShowDebugLogs] = useState(true);
```

Debug logs show:

- Filtering operations
- Error messages and warnings
