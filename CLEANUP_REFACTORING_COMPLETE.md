### 3. ✅ Fixed Navigation Issues
- **Open Tool button** in Network tab now correctly navigates to `/gisProfessionalDashboard`
- Updated routing path from `/gis-dashboard` to `/gisProfessionalDashboard`

### 4. ✅ Fixed Authentication Issues

### 8. ✅ Industry-Oriented Folder Structure
**New organized structure:**
```
src/components/
├── features/
│   ├── network/
│   │   └── NetworkPage/ (formerly 4.NetworkPage)
│   ├── administration/
│   │   └── AdministrationPage/ (formerly 5.AdministrationPage)
│   └── dashboard/
│       └── MainDashboard/ (formerly pages/dashboard)
├── auth/
├── common/
├── gis/
├── layout/
├── MeasureDistance/
└── WorkingMeasurementMap.jsx
```

### 9. ✅ Updated Import Paths
- Updated `App.jsx` imports to reflect new folder structure
- Maintained backward compatibility for existing functionality

## 🎯 Performance Improvements

1. **Reduced Bundle Size** - Removed ~8 unused hook files
2. **Cleaner Architecture** - Better organized component structure
3. **Improved Responsiveness** - Enhanced sidebar and map positioning
4. **Better UX** - Smoother transitions and proper component repositioning

## 🛡️ Security Improvements

1. **Forced Login** - Users must authenticate on every session
2. **No Stored Sessions** - Automatic session restoration disabled
3. **Clean State** - Application starts with fresh state every time

## 🗺️ GIS Features Enhanced

1. **Unrestricted Tool Access** - Tools now work globally, not just in assigned regions
2. **Better Map Visibility** - Reduced sidebar size for more map space
3. **Responsive Controls** - Map controls and panels reposition with sidebar
4. **Enhanced User Experience** - Smoother interactions and better visual feedback

## 📁 Files Modified

### Core Application Files:
- `src/App.jsx` - Updated imports and disabled session restoration
